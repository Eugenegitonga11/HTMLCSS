    <p>In this example, you were able to learn the working of the pushbutton which is an essential part 
        of electronics. You learnt how to use a pushbutton to trigger an event - in this case to turn on an 
        LED when the pushbutton is pressed and turn it off when released. 
        With what you have learned in this simple project, you can create countless other projects. Here 
        are some ideas to test your skills:
        Modify the code to change the LED state when you press the pushbutton once so that 
        you don't have to hold the pushbutton to keep the LED lit. The LED will come on and 
        remain on when you press the push button once, then turn off and remain off when you 
        press it again.
